# RouteLogSystem
Python scripts for ArcMap - Automating production of VTrans Straight Line Diagrams

In addition to these Python scripts, VTrans Route Log production requires a license for ArcGIS Desktop 10.X and all relavent GIS input data.  Some current data is available through the Vermont Open Geodata Portal, and sample data is available upon personal request via this project.
